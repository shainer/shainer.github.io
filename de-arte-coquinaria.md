This page contains an English translation of _Libro de arte coquinaria_ by
[Mastro Martino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martino_da_Como).

This book, written around 1465, is one of the most famous historical cookbooks;
the book was highly influential during his time as well, leading some to
regard Mastro Martino as the first celebrity chef.

This is an amateur translation from the old Italian of the time to English,
made by me as a personal project. I have not spent much time in corrections
and editing; I might do so and release an improved version in the future.
