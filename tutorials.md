This page contains a few tutorials I have written over the years. Please note that some
of them may be obsolete by now.

*  [PyQt](http://www.python.it/wiki/show/qttutorial): tutorial in Italian to use the PyQt library. The link redirects
to the python.it website, where the guide is hosted.
*  [Flex](tutorials/flex.md): introduction to writing basic scanners with Flex.
*  [The Git Handbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/shainer/git-handbook/details): handbook on Git, hosted on my account
on Gitbook. This guide is aimed at people looking for a short and easy overview of the most popular features of Git,
or people looking for a reference for common procedures.
*  [Matasano walkthrough](https://www.gitbook.com/book/shainer/matasano-crypto-challenges-walkthrough/details):
in 2016 I have started solving the [Matasano crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com). I have not finished yet; the
solutions are public on [Github](https://github.com/shainer/matasano). This book will contain a walkthrough of all
the public challenges, explaining the theory necessary to understand why something works in a certain way.
The book, as the solutions, is work-in-progress.

Contributions to any of this are welcome; for guides hosted on Gitbook you can use Gitbook directly to contribute.
