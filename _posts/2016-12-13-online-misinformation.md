### Introduction
Not so long ago, I mentioned that I hate bad news and that I am planning to implement a clickbait classifier.

But obviously bad news are not limited to articles with a clickbait title.

Inspired by a reference on a debunking blog, I had a look at some of the recent scientific literature on the spreading of
misinformation over the Internet.

In this article I will summarize some interesting things I have found. All material is linked in full form in the References 
section at the end of the post.

Brace yourself, this is going to be a long one!
