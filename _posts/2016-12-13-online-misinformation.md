Not so long ago, I mentioned "hating bad news" and planning to implement a clickbait classifier. But obviously bad news are not limited to articles with a clickbait title. Inspired by a reference on a debunking blog, I had a look at some of the recent scientific literature on the spreading of misinformation over the Internet.

In this article I will summarize some interesting things I have found. All material is linked in full form in the References section at the end of the post.

Brace yourself, this is going to be a long one!

### The background
Most papers or articles mentioned the same report, produced by the World Economic Forum in 2013.

In this report, it is commented how the Internet enables pretty much everybody to become the source of widely-spread information, whether true or not. This contrasts with the past, where it was still possible, but restricted to the few "powers" with the practical means to reach many people at once (e.g. large TV stations).

False information has often clear consequences, regardless of whether the original source intended them. Even satire news, meant to mock the gullibility of users, can cause them if taken seriously for too long. Moreover, malign sources, with an agenda to push, abound.

The report then discusses possible actions to take to combat these so-called _digital wildfires_: it explains why restrictions on freedom of speech may backfire, and explores the idea of "augmenting" the Internet experience with tools to warn users about low credibility sites, perform basilar fact-checking, and similar functionalities.

This is very similar to what many large IT companies, such as Facebook, have been proposing these days.
